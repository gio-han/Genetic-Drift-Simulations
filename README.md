Genetic_Drift_Simulations_and_Plots

A script containing 2 functions to simulate genetic drift and to plot the results.

"Genetic drift is the change in the frequency of an (gene variant) in a population over multiple
generations. An individualâ€™s alleles are a sample of those in present their parents and
chance has a role in determining whether that individual will survive and reproduce. Genetic
drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely from a population and thereby reduce
genetic variation."
